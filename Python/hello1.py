# This is a very simpe python program. Yes! That is how easy it is to
# write a program... see, anyone can write code! To run this and furute
# programs type the following into the command prompt: python <file_name>
# In this case: python hello1.py
# Which will prent the string "Hello, world!"
print("Hello, world!")

# Expected output:
# ================
# $ python hello1.py
# Hello, world


# By the way, lines that start with "#" are not ran as code, these are considered
# comments, it is a good idea to comment your code about what is happening, although
# not as much as I have been in these examples and lessons
